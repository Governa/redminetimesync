WHAT IS THIS?
- This is meant to help people (like me) that use both Hamster Applet (Gnome Time Tracker) and Redmine to keep trace of activities done.


PREREQUISITES
* Redmine >= v1.1
* Python on your local machine


INSTALLATION
1) Clone the repository: git clone git://github.com/shaftoe/redminetimesync.git
2) Edit redminetimesync.config: it's an INI-like file that needs two parameters:

url: your Redmine public url
key: your Redmine API key

You can find your API key on your account page ( /my/account ) when logged in, on the right-hand pane of the default layout.
You'll have to enable Redmine REST API in Administration -> Settings -> Authentication


USAGE
1) Log activities in Hamster, precising Redmine issue ID. Valid log entries are :
'#134: Adding some interesting stuff'
'Fix #243'
'Adding logging output (#132)'

2) run the python script: ./redminetimesync.py
- with no parameter, it will sync time entries for today
- if you want to sync past days, add an integer as parameter (e.g. "./redminetimesync.py 1" for yesteday, "./redminetimesync.py 3" for 3 days ago, etc)
